A project for creating and analysing Snake and Ladder games using Python.

The Python file contains the classes used to implement the game, as well as the (commented out) testing code.

The images are class diagrams used for planning, with the first modelling the connections between the squares as classes while the second doesn't. The latter was what the code was based on.
